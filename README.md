# AlgunasVainas

Algunas Vainas (Colombian Spanish slang for "some things") is a code base consisting of the following:

REST API (C#, .NET Core)
Web Application (React.js)
Unit Tests

This code was written using Visual Studio Community 2019 (impressive IDE!).

April 22, 2019

v.1.0 Release

I tried to put some scalable architecture around the API with the use of Services and Repositories (and interfaces for the Repositories).

I'm new to React.js, so ... doing my best there. Trying to incorporate things that will be useful like Routing, Axios, and React Bootstrap.

I dig TDD ... the Test code helped me build this thing (at least the code that makes up the API). 

Currently the code is super vanilla -- I plan to keep updating it. I hope it will be useful to someone who's learning. Let me know what you think -- I'd like to learn something as well.

I actually pushed the resources to Azure if you'd like to check it out:
