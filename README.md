# Algunas Vainas

Algunas Vainas (Colombian Spanish slang for "some things") is a code base consisting of the following:

* REST API (C#, .NET Core)
* Web Application (React.js)
* Unit Tests

### Prerequisites & Getting Started

This code was written using Visual Studio Community 2019 (impressive IDE!). 
Web app code points to where I have the REST API hosted in Azure. Configure AlgunasVainas.Website to be the StartUp Project if debugging.

### Releases & Notes

*April 22, 2019*

**v.1.0 Release Notes**

* I tried to put some scalable architecture around the API with the use of Services and Repositories (and interfaces for the Repositories).

* I'm new to React.js, so ... doing my best there. Trying to incorporate things that will be useful like Routing, Axios, and React Bootstrap.

* I dig TDD ... the Test code helped me build this thing (at least the code that makes up the API). 

The code is super vanilla -- I hope it will be useful to someone who's learning. Let me know what you think because I'd like to learn something as well.
